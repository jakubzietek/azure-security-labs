# Lab 01 — Azure RBAC \& Least Privilege



## Goal

Design and implement least-privilege access using Azure RBAC at the correct scope.



## Scenario

A security team needs to grant operational access to Azure resources without

over-privileging users or breaking separation of duties.


## Threats mitigated

\- Excessive permissions / privilege creep

\- Accidental or malicious resource modification

\- Lack of accountability at scope boundaries



## Architecture

## Implementation steps

1\. Create resource group for lab

2\. Assign built-in roles at different scopes

3\. (Optional) Create custom role with minimal permissions

4\. Test access boundaries



## Validation
