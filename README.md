# Azure Security Labs

Hands-on Azure security engineering labs focused on identity, access management,
network security, data protection, governance, and monitoring.

These labs are aligned with AZ-500 objectives but designed and documented
as real-world security engineering scenarios rather than exam-only exercises.

## What this repository demonstrates
- Azure identity & access design (RBAC, PIM, Conditional Access)
- Secure secrets management (Key Vault, Managed Identities)
- Network and data hardening (NSGs, private endpoints)
- Security posture management (Defender for Cloud)
- Detection & response (Microsoft Sentinel)
- Security decision-making, trade-offs, and validation

## Lab structure
Each lab contains:
- Problem statement & threat model
- Architecture overview
- Step-by-step implementation
- Validation / proof of security
- Production considerations

## Status
🚧 Work in progress — labs added incrementally
